# Inventory Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project involved consolidating multiple tables using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to create a unified dataset for easier visualization and analysis. A **Power BI dashboard** was then developed to present key insights interactively and dynamically.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Power BI**

## Project Summary
### **Data Consolidation & Processing:**
1. Identified relevant tables containing essential data for analysis.
2. Leveraged **SSMS** to join tables based on common keys and relationships.
3. Created a **centralized consolidated table**, eliminating the need for repetitive queries and joins.

### **Dashboard Development:**
1. Imported the consolidated table into **Power BI** for visualization.
2. Designed an interactive **dashboard** showcasing key insights.
3. Included **charts, graphs, and tables** representing **metrics, trends, and patterns**.
4. Implemented **filtering and drill-down features** to enhance interactivity and data exploration.

## Key Features
- **Single Source of Truth:** Eliminates complexity by consolidating data into one repository.
- **Enhanced Visualization:** Interactive **Power BI dashboard** with rich visual elements.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Enables quick insights for improved strategy formulation.
- **Dynamic Filtering & Drill-down:** Users can explore detailed insights based on specific criteria.

## Conclusion
By utilizing **SSMS** for data integration and **Power BI** for visualization, this project streamlined data accessibility and enhanced analytical capabilities.
